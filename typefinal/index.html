                 “Don’t Judge a Book By Its Cover”. It’s a statement drilled into our heads since childhood by parents, teachers, books, and movies. But as a kid, I couldn’t help myself. If I picked up a book and it was unpleasant to look at I could not get past it. As a chlid and teen I devoured books like my life depended on it. I would go through entire books in a single day, spending all my birthday money at Barnes & Noble. Yet I couldn’t bring myself to read a book whose cover had clashing colors, ugly fonts, or letters set too close to each other. This was a huge part of the realization for me that I wanted to be a graphic designer. I never wanted anyone to have to look at ugly books, ugly posters, ugly anything (Or to have to look at them myself). <br><br>In adulthood I’ve begun to collect books from thrift stores, yard sales, and vintage markets; one because I carry that love of reading throughout my life, two because I simply love looking at them. I think it is so interesting how much of a books identity can be understood just from looking at its cover. The spine is what we see when it’s on the shelf, but the cover is what we see when we want to know something about it without reading a word. At this point in my life I have collected hundreds of books, so narrowing down to just five items was very difficult. But these books, sourced from a variety of thrift stores, sidewalk sales, and vintage stores, are ones that have typography that particulary interest me.</div>

        <div id="circle">Aa</div><div id="fact1">The title font used is likely the all caps Schmalfette Grotesk, which literally translates to “bold condensed sans-serif” in German, or its mixed case descendant, Haettenschweiler. The Font has been criticized for its illegibility at small sizes due to its narrow counters and tight apertures. These features, however, made the font popular in Newspapers and Book Covers where the goal was to convey a feeling of aggression. It later inspired similar fonts like “Compacta” & “Impact”. What specifically helped me differentiate this font from others was the curve of the R.<img id="font1" src="font1.png"> </div>

			<hr>
			I bought this book at a Goodwill in St Charles Illinois. I was attracted to the left aligned type, something you don’t often see on book covers. The typeface is tall but very heavy- the counter space is very small and there are subtle differences in weight throughout each individual letter, giving it the very dark and authoritarian feel that is very appropriate for the book.

        <div id="circle2">Aa</div><div id="fact2">After a lot of research, I am almost certain that the title font is unique to this specific cover, or it has not been digitized since this cover’s release in 1969. I did find dozens of very similar fonts on the internet, which are undoubtedly trying to reference the 1960s science fiction aesthetic. Peach Melba and Lazenby Computer are two of those modern fonts.<img id="font2" src="font2.png"><img id="font22" src="font22.png"> </div>

			I bought this book at a sidewalk sale. I was intrigued by the super futuristic font used for the title. I haven’t really seen any other books use a font as experimental as this but it immediately made me think of the kind of science fiction that Ubik is full of.

        <div id="circle3">Aa</div><div id="fact3">I have not been able to identify this font with any certainty, though it looks most similar to me to a distressed version of Duera, However that would be impossible as Duera was released in 2016 and this edition of the book in 1989. It also bears striking similarity to Surfoid, released in 2018. It is certainly possible that these two fonts took inspiration from the actual font used, or that the font was only recently digitized. <img id="font3" src="font3.png"><img id="font33" src="font33.png"> </div>

			<hr>
			I bought this book at Green Element Resale in Edgewater. I loved the bright teal, yellow, pink and green. The font is childlike and playful, but does not feel corny or unprofessional. The design both compliments the setting of 1980’s Miami, and contrasts the dark tones of a murder mystery plot.

        <div id="circle4">Aa</div><div id="fact4">This font appears to be Akzidenz Grotesk, which was first released in 1898. It was notable at this time for its simplicity among the decorative san-serifs of the Art Nouveau style.The font has great variation between its different weights and widths, but this specific one features a very distinct lowercase C and S, whose strokes do not end horizontally. The font became as iconic as it is during the midcentury as part of the Swiss design style and is still extremely popular to this day. Different weights of the font are featured in branding for the American Red Cross, the Air Force, and NASCAR, to name a few. <img id="font4" src="font4.png"></div>

			I bought this book at the Village Discount in Roscoe Village. I loved the simple, all lowercase sans-serif used for the title. The typeface feels approachable yet stern. As a whole the cover is very simple and abstract but extremely eye-catching.

        <div id="circle5">Aa</div><div id="fact5">The title font here is ITC Serif Gothic Bold, with the use of alternatives for T, E, R, and A. The alternatives were available as part of a promotion in 1972. Designed by Herb Lubalin and Anthony DiSpigna, the font is unique and versatile, achieving vast popularity after its release. It was featured on book and album covers, in advertisements, and perhaps most famously, for Star Wars. <img id="font5" src="font5.png"></div>

			<hr>
			I also bought this book at Village Discount in Roscoe Village. I guess someone was getting rid of their Camus collection. I love the font used for this cover and how the size is easily varied across each word without losing readability. It feels more like 60’s album art than a book cover to me.
