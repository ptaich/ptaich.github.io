			<h3 id="about">ABOUT THE EXHIBITION<br><br><hr></h3> 


			<p>“Don’t Judge a Book By Its Cover”. It’s a statement drilled into our heads since childhood by parents, teachers, books, and movies. But as a kid, I couldn’t help myself. If I picked up a book and it was unpleasant to look at I could not get past it. As a chlid and teen I devoured books like my life depended on it. I would go through entire books in a single day, spending all my birthday money at Barnes & Noble. Yet I couldn’t bring myself to read a book whose cover had clashing colors, ugly fonts, letters set too close to each other. This was a huge part of the realization for me that I wanted to be a graphic designer. I never wanted anyone to have to look at ugly books, ugly posters, ugly anything (Or to have to look at them myself). <br><br>In adulthood I’ve begun to collect books from thrift stores, yard sales, and vintage markets- one because I carry that love of reading throughout my life, two because I simply love looking at them. I think it is so interesting how much of a books identity can be understood just from looking at its cover. The spine is what we see when it’s on the shelf, but the cover is what we see when we want to know something about it without reading a word. At this point in my life I have collected hundreds of books, so narrowing down to just five items was very difficult. But these books, sourced from a variety of thrift stores, sidewalk sales, and vintage stores, are ones that have typography that particulary interest me. </p>

			<h2>Anthem By Ayn Rand</h2>

		<div id="anthem">
			<h3>ANTHEM</h3>
			<h4>AYN RAND</h4>
			<hr>
			I bought this book at a Goodwill in St Charles Illinois. I was attracted to the left aligned type, something you don’t often see on book covers. The typeface is tall but very heavy- the counter space is very small and there are subtle differences in weight throughout each individual letter, giving it the very dark and authoritarian feel that is very appropriate for the book.

			I bought this book at a sidewalk sale. I was intrigued by the super futuristic font used for the title. I haven’t really seen any other books use a font as experimental as this but it immediately made me think of the kind of science fiction that Ubik is full of.

			I bought this book at Green Element Resale in Edgewater. I loved the bright teal, yellow, pink and green. The font is childlike and playful, but does not feel corny or unprofessional. The design both compliments the setting of 1980’s Miami, and contrasts the dark tones of a murder mystery plot.

			<h3>THE MYTH OF SISYPHUS</h3>
			<h4>ALBERT CAMUS</h4>
			<hr>
			I bought this book at the Village Discount in Roscoe Village. I loved the simple, all lowercase sans-serif used for the title. The typeface feels approachable yet stern. As a whole the cover is very simple and abstract but extremely eye-catching.

			<h3>THE STRANGER</h3>
			<h4>ALBERT CAMUS</h4>
			<hr>
			I also bought this book at Village Discount in Roscoe Village. I guess someone was getting rid of their Camus collection. I love the font used for this cover and how the size is easily varied across each word without losing readability. It feels more like 60’s album art than a book cover to me.
