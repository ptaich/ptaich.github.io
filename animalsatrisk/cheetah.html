                 <div> <p>There are five subspecies of this big cat. It is slim and has muscular, long legs — in relation to its body size when compared to other cats — a small, rounded head that is set on a long neck, a flexible spine, a deep chest, special pads on its feet for traction, and a long tail for balance. It is also the only cat that cannot retract its claws, an adaptation to help maintain traction like a soccer player’s cleats. It also bears distinctive black “tear tracks” running from the inside corner of each eye to the mouth that may serve as an anti-glare mechanism for daytime hunting. <br><br>This cat is a solitary animal. Males have been seen living in coalitions, where they appear extremely tolerant of close proximity to other males. The related members of the coalition will even take part in play and physical contact such as grooming, whereas the unrelated males will generally stick to themselves while remaining in the coalition. Like all females, there are some males who stick to themselves who do not belong to a coalition. They never stay in one place for long and are referred to as nomads.

             <h3 id="threats2">HUMAN INTERFERENCE</h3>
            <p id="hab"> Cheetahs tend to encounter conflict with farmers when the decline of their natural prey leads them to attack livestock, resulting in farmers killing them in retaliation. As human populations grow and expand, agriculture, roads, and settlements destroy the open grasslands that this big cat calls home. Total cheetah populations have been estimated to be 6,674 adults and adolescents. There is a low density of the cat across its range, meaning it needs larges areas of connected habitat for their survival. The majority of known cheetah range (76 percent) exists on unprotected lands. This leaves populations to be extremely fragmented, which is cause for concern for their future.<br><br>Live cheetahs are caught and traded illegally to the exotic pet trade and they are also poached for their skin. The East African region is where illegal live trade is most likely to have the greatest negative impact on wild populations. Although the exact origin of the trade is unclear, information from interdictions and interviews with traders suggests that cheetahs are opportunistically collected from Somali regions, including parts of Ethiopia and Kenya, and occasionally beyond.

             <h3 id="climate">CLIMATE CHANGE</h3>
             <p id="climate2"> In some areas, the cheetahs’ prey populations are declining. As  a result of this, cheetahs have had to change their diets – and prey on other animals that live in the same environment.

And, a rise in temperatures has even affected this big cat’s ability to reproduce. 

Some studies have shown that many male cheetahs have lowered testosterone levels. 

In some instances, cheetah sperm counts were seen to be almost ten times lower than your average house cat.

And scientists believe that these findings are due to the higher temperatures caused by global warming.</p>
