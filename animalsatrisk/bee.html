                 <div> <p>The Rusty Patched Bumblebeelives in a variety of habitats, including prairies, woodlands, marshes, farms, parks and gardens. Once found in 29 states and 2 Canadian provinces, its current range is limited to scattered locations within 10 states:  Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Ohio, Virginia, Wisconsin and Ontario. The rusty patched bumble bee is listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act.<br><br>

Rusty patched bumble bees are habitat generalists, but are typically found in areas that contain natural and semi-natural upland grassland, shrubland, woodlands, and forests. They may also be found in urban or suburban areas that contain nesting habitat, nectar and pollen resources, and overwintering habitat. In the spring they are often found in and near woodland habitats.</p></div>

            <p id="hab"> increasing temperatures and precipitation are also increasing the species' risk of extinction. The likelihood of a bumblebee population surviving in a single location has declined by an average of 30% within one human generation. Climate change also impacts the chances of bees colonizing new areas. They discovered that the largest bumblebee population declines occurred in places where "climate change was pushing species past what they ever had to tolerate before." These areas are represented in dark red spots on a data map, which does not include population data based on habitat loss and pesticides.

                <br><br>The decline of bumblebee populations could also spell trouble for agriculture. Bumblebees are vital to the world's ecosystem and are known for pollinating wildflowers and "nightshade" produce such as tomatoes, eggplants, peppers, and blueberries, according to the Honeybee Conservancy. They are able to tolerate cooler weather that other crucial pollinators, like honey bees, cannot effectively withstand. Other research has found that the bees are essential in supporting seeds and berries that other animals need in their diets.

             <h3 id="climate">HUMAN INTERACTION</h3>
             <p id="climate2"> 
"Just as human activities cause climate change today, bumblebee species may need human intervention to help them establish new populations in cooler and more northerly environments," Kerr says. That said, scientists shouldn't start moving bumblebees north without thinking about how this might impact species that are already in those areas, he says. Humans could cause a lot of damage if bumblebees start competing with other, equally useful animals. In addition, some bumblebee species — like Europe's buff-tailed bumblebee — are doing pretty well, so moving them wouldn't do much good. "Big global patterns are a step," Cameron says, but scientists need to understand the details, too.For now, gardeners can help bumblebees by adding wild flowers to their yards, the researchers say. But planting wild flowers might not be enough in the long term. Bumblebees are already battling habitat loss and pesticide use — factors that may place an eventual comeback out of reach.</p>
