                 <div> <p>The koala is an iconic Australian animal. Often called the koala “bear,” this tree-climbing animal is a marsupial—a mammal with a pouch for the development of offspring.

Though koalas look fuzzy, their hair is more like the coarse wool of a sheep. They have two opposing thumbs on their hands, and both their feet and hands have rough pads and claws to grab onto branches. They have two toes, fused together, on their feet, which they use to comb their fur <br><br>Koalas live in the eucalyptus forests of southeastern and eastern Australia. When not sleeping, they’re usually eating. They rely on the eucalyptus tree for both habitat and food. Koalas can eat more than a pound of eucalyptus leaves a day. Eucalyptus is toxic, so the koala’s digestive system has to work hard to digest it, breaking down the toxins and extracting limited nutrients.

That’s why koalas sleep so much—they get very little energy from their diet. Tucked into forks or nooks in the trees, koalas may sleep for 18 to 22 hours.

Koalas usually don’t drink much water as they get most of their moisture from these leaves. Koalas can even store leaves in their cheek pouches for later. They eat so much eucalyptus that they often take on its smell.

             <h3 id="threats2">HABITAT LOSS & FRAGMENTATION</h3>
            <p id="hab"> Increasing atmospheric CO2 levels will reduce the
nutritional quality of Eucalyptus leaves, causing nutrient
shortages in the species that forage on them. As a result,
Koalas may no longer be able to meet their nutritional
demands, resulting in malnutrition and starvation.  Increasing frequency and intensity of droughts can
force Koalas to descend from trees in search of water or
new habitats. This makes them particularly vulnerable to
wild and domestic predators, as well as to road traffic,
often resulting in death. <br><br>he eucalyptus remaining to the animals has lowered in nutritional value due to higher CO2 emissions in the atmosphere. They are difficult animals to monitor, as in different regions throughout Australia their numbers are not necessarily dropping. In the past twenty years, koala numbers have dropped by 40 percent in Queensland, but in Victoria and Southern Australia, koalas have actually seen such an increase in population that they have been eating themselves out of habitat.

             <h3 id="climate">RISING TEMPERATURES</h3>
             <p id="climate2"> One alarming, but potentially very important, aspect of the study highlighted how higher temperatures and extreme weather are risky to koala safety. One quarter of the koalas followed by the researchers were whipped out by the heatwave that came before Australia’s Black Saturday bush fires in 2009. Before colonizers arrived in Australia, an estimated 10 million koalas lived on the continent. Today, however, this iconic Australian mammal numbers approximately 43, 000.</p>
